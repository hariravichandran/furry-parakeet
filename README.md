# Amswers to Questions 1 - 6:
1. Yes, the total emissions of PM2.5 from 1999 to 2008 have decreased as shown by the graph.
2. Yes, total emissions from 1999 to 2008 in Baltimore City, MD have decreased, though not in a continuously, going up again in 2005 and back down in 2008.
3. Of the four emissions sources in Baltimore City, all of the sources (nonroad, nonpoint, onroad, and point) have seen decreases in emissions from 1999 to 2008. None of the sources have seen increases in emissions during these years.
4. Emissions from all coal-combustion sources have decreased from 1999 to 2008.
5. Emissions from motor vehicle sources have decreased from 1999 to 2008.
6. Emissions from Baltimore City are roughly an order of magnitude less than the emissions in Los Angeles.
